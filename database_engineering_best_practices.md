## Database Design

### Schema Design

- **Normalize appropriately**: Follow normalization principles (1NF through 5NF) but be pragmatic about denormalization for performance when necessary
- **Use consistent naming conventions**:
  - Table names: singular or plural, but be consistent (e.g., `customer` or `customers`)
  - Column names: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `first_name`) or camelCase (e.g., `firstName`)
  - Primary keys: `id` or `table_name_id`
  - Foreign keys: `referenced_table_name_id` or `referenced_table_id`
- **Choose appropriate data types**:
  - Use the smallest data type that can reliably contain your data
  - Consider storage and performance implications of each data type
  - Use fixed-length types when the length is known and consistent
- **Implement constraints**:
  - Primary keys on all tables
  - Foreign keys for referential integrity
  - Unique constraints where appropriate
  - Check constraints to enforce business rules
  - Not null constraints for required fields

### Indexing Strategy

- **Index selection criteria**:
  - Columns used in WHERE clauses
  - Columns used in JOIN conditions
  - Columns used in ORDER BY and GROUP BY
  - Foreign key columns
- **Index types**:
  - B-tree indexes for equality and range queries
  - Hash indexes for equality comparisons
  - Full-text indexes for text search
  - Spatial indexes for geographic data
- **Composite indexes**:
  - Order columns from most selective to least selective
  - Consider query patterns when determining column order
- **Index maintenance**:
  - Regularly analyze index usage
  - Remove unused indexes
  - Rebuild fragmented indexes

### Partitioning

- **Partition large tables** based on:
  - Range partitioning (e.g., date ranges)
  - List partitioning (e.g., specific values)
  - Hash partitioning (e.g., even distribution)
- **Benefits of partitioning**:
  - Improved query performance
  - Easier maintenance
  - Efficient archiving of old data
- **Partition pruning**: Ensure queries can take advantage of partitioning

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

- **Write efficient queries**:
  - Select only needed columns (avoid `SELECT *`)
  - Use appropriate JOINs (INNER, LEFT, etc.)
  - Filter data as early as possible in the query
  - Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries when appropriate
  - Avoid functions on indexed columns in WHERE clauses
- **Use query hints judiciously**:
  - Only when the optimizer consistently makes poor choices
  - Document why the hint is necessary
- **Pagination**:
  - Implement for large result sets
  - Use keyset pagination (WHERE id > last_id) instead of OFFSET for large tables
- **Batch operations**:
  - Process large operations in smaller batches
  - Consider time-of-day for batch processing

### Database Configuration
